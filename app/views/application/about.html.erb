  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>Friday, October 4th, 2024</p>
  <p>There were several places where I resided in the New Orleans area, including Old Jefferson, Uptown, Mid-City, Marigny, 9th Ward, Mandeville, and finally Amite City for the final 6 years. 
  As a postal worker in Louisiana, I worked in various offices, including Amite, Covington, Mount Hermon, and Franklinton. Currently in Greer, 
  I am soon returning to the academy for the fourth time to become a City Carrier Associate in Taylors, SC.</p>
  
  <p>I was a musician for at least 20 years of my life. I learned by playing along with the radio as a child and later attended the 
  New Orleans Center for Creative Arts during high school. NOCCA taught me all the theory I needed to become a passionate and productive composer and bassist. 
  I sometimes resent the Jazz Education format, which aims to keep students within the boundaries of “the tradition,” essentially stifling the evolution of Jazz music. 
  I’ve worked throughout my professional career to unlearn the ideals instilled in me. I believe in keeping an open mind and hearing music as an uneducated listener, 
  free from critical, technical thought. More on this to come.</p>
